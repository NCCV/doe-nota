# DoeNota

DoeNota is an app used for converting part of the taxes payed by Brazilians into revenue for the NCCV NGO. When you buy something in Brazil you receive an invoice. During the payment, you’re asked to inform your ID to get back part of it. When you do not inform your ID, a NGO can request the amount from the government.

DoeNota was created to be used only in the state of São Paulo and at the moment you get your invoice, you can scan it through OCR or the QR Code and send it to the NCCV immediately through the internet. After that, the NGO just consolidate the data to send to government in a very straightforward way.

Today, the NGO can focus in what matters: Make the people lives better, instead of typing invoices.
